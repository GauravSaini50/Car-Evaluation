# Car-Evaluation
This project centers on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a categorical dataset related to car acceptability. The dataset includes features such as:
- Buying price
- Maintenance cost
- Number of doors
- Passenger capacity
- Luggage boot size
- Safety rating
- Overall classification
The data is preprocessed to assign meaningful column names and encode categorical attributes into numerical formats using LabelEncoder. Visual tools like heatmaps are employed to examine inter-feature correlations, uncover hidden patterns, and guide future modeling decisions.
The goal is to develop insights into how individual car features might influence overall acceptability. This analysis serves as a foundation for downstream tasks such as feature selection or building classification models.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
